### I do, for wasting my time on social media.
Originally this program was intended to limit my use of YouTube (the name is actually a very funny pun, you see).

## It is simple to use:
1) [Download](https://github.com/tommaier123/YouSuck/releases) and start the program (you can use the installer to put it into autostart). You might need to [download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and install the .net6 Desktop Runtime
2) YouSuck checks your browser and tracks how much time you waste on unproductive websites
3) You can click on the icon in the tray to see how much time is on the counter
4) If the time reaches 30 minutes it closes the browser
5) This is not the end though. You get rewarded for working. Every key you type reduces the counter by 0.3 seconds
6) When you want to close the program it might seem like it's broken but thats on purpose. You will have to click multiple times to make sure you know what you are doing. The higher the counter the more you need to click.

The values I have set up work well for me but might not work for you. I would have made them settings but it would be much too easy to turn off.
If there is enough demand I might make different version with different settings though. Similarly if there is a site or browser you want to add, let me know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/tommaier123/YouSuck/issues) or pullrequest
